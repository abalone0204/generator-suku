#My React Labs

Hi, 

here is the basic and simple setting for web development.

(Not only for react, but it's simple enough to test a simple react component)

- Thanks @gaearon, [react-transform-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate) really save my world from messy workflow.

# Usage

- First, you need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- Then you should install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

- Run `npm install`

    - Every node modules dependency will be settle.

- Enter `npm start` in your command-line, and go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

- And you can write your scss in `static/stylesheets/style.scss`, and requrie your node modules in your `src/main.js`

- If you need to compile the `bundle.js`:

```
npm run build
```
